# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: **Betterment**

* When was the company incorporated?
**Betterment** was founded in 2008. 

* Who are the founders of the company?
The founders are Jon Stein, a Columbia Business School MBA graduate, and Eli Broverman, a lawyer out of NYU School of Law. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Broverman and Stein were prepared to offer financial advice online as an SEC-registered investment advisor, and also decided to offer broker-dealer services for advice to customers. **Betterment** added Ryan O'Sullivan, a "serial entrepreneur", to establish **Betterment**'s broker-dealer operation.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
**Betterment** received Series A round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. By October 2012, Menlo Ventures provided Series B funding along with Bessemer Venture Partners and Anthemis Group. By 2012, the company established product offerings, such as IRAs, auto-deposit, auto-rebalancing, and goal-based investing advice. **Betterment** has received $45 million in venture funding.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    * A common complaint about **Betterment** is its cost, though you’ll see just as many people say the pricing is a good thing. Compared to Vanguard, the company from which **Betterment** buys the ETFs it puts in its user portfolios, **Betterment** is pricey.
    * Because they make every aspect of investment so easy, even automating re-allocations, tax harvesting measures, and Tax-coordinated asset movement (putting expensive holdings in tax-protected accounts, cheap holdings in taxable accounts), some complain that these essential skills are never learned by the account holder.
    * **Betterment** is about diversification with as little buying and selling as possible. That’s why they use Vanguard ETFs. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is just like a mutual fund, with an important variation. ETFs trade just like stocks. Without getting into the details, there are contrary theories that question the sensibility of including “Emerging Markets” in the **Betterment** portfolio, claiming that this is just a show of diversification without producing meaningful results for users.
    * There is also the more specific issue of tax loss harvesting. This is an automatic service in which **Betterment**’s algorithms automatically sell losing options in order to “lock in” losses and drive down capital gains taxes down the road. If They Aren't Careful, **Betterment** Users Can End Up With Tax Problems

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    #### **Betterment** is best for
        * Hands-off investors.
        * Retirement investors.
        * Users with low balances.
        * Those who want automatic rebalancing.
        * Users who like goal-based tools.
    #### Benefits of using **Betterment**
        * Account minimum: Betterment is one of the few robo-advisors that doesn't require a minimum deposit. However, that applies only to its Betterment Digital offering. 
        * High-yield cash account: Betterment also offers a way for you to stash your savings with them. Called Cash Reserve, it comes with an interest rate of 0.30%. (This interest rate is variable and may change.) Your savings will get up to $1 million in FDIC insurance coverage, there's no minimum balance requirement, and you won't pay a fee on your balance.
    #### Market Size of the set of customers
        As of March, Betterment boasts 500,000 accounts with an average account size of $44,000.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
    * Mobile Technologies
    * Automation
    * APIs
    * Cloud Services

    **Betterment** uses the automation technology the most. Everything is automated and that's another reason why it's considered a robo advisor. (*Robo Advisor - robot/automated advisor*). APIs and Mobile technology support the app to connect to 3rd party apps such as banking applications where people invest money from or through a verification process, **Betterment** sends sms to the the user's phone number with a verification code. The code is intercepted by the application and user is allowed to perform the desired action. All the data has to be keept in a database or a Data Warehouse. In order to let all the applications (website, mobile app) to communicate to each other, they need a live database and this involves cloud services.
