## Instructions

### Setup the custom out-of-the-box blockchain

* Create a new project directory for your new network. Call it whatever you want!

* Create a "Screenshots" folder inside of the project directory.

* Create accounts for two (or more) nodes for the network with a separate `datadir` for each using `geth`.

* Run `puppeth`, name your network, and select the option to configure a new genesis block.

* Choose the `Clique (Proof of Authority)` consensus algorithm.

* Paste both account addresses from the first step one at a time into the list of accounts to seal.

* Paste them again in the list of accounts to pre-fund. There are no block rewards in PoA, so you'll need to pre-fund.

* You can choose `no` for pre-funding the pre-compiled accounts (0x1 .. 0xff) with wei. This keeps the genesis cleaner.

* Complete the rest of the prompts, and when you are back at the main menu, choose the "Manage existing genesis" option.

* Export genesis configurations. This will fail to create two of the files, but you only need `networkname.json`.

* You can delete the `networkname-harmony.json` file.

* Screenshot the `puppeth` configuration once complete and save it to the Screenshots folder.

* Initialize each node with the new `networkname.json` with `geth`.

* Run the first node, unlock the account, enable mining, and the RPC flag. Only one node needs RPC enabled.

* Set a different peer port for the second node and use the first node's `enode` address as the `bootnode` flag.

* Be sure to unlock the account and enable mining on the second node!

* You should now see both nodes producing new blocks, congratulations!

### Send a test transaction

* Use the MyCrypto GUI wallet to connect to the node with the exposed RPC port.

* You will need to use a custom network, and include the chain ID, and use ETH as the currency.

* Import the keystore file from the `node1/keystore` directory into MyCrypto. This will import the private key.

* Send a transaction from the `node1` account to the `node2` account.

* Copy the transaction hash and paste it into the "TX Status" section of the app, or click "TX Status" in the popup.

* Screenshot the transaction metadata (status, tx hash, block number, etc) and save it to your Screenshots folder.

* Celebrate, you just created a blockchain and sent a transaction!
