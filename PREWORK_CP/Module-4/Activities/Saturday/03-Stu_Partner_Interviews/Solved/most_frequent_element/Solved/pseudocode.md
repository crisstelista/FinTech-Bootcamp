```
initiate a variable, i.e. counter with 0 value.
get the first element of the list because of its datatype and assign it to a ELEMENT variable
iterate over the list 
    and then get the frequency of the element inside the list
        if the new frequency is greater than the counter variable then
            counter variable should become frequency
            and 
            overwrite the ELEMENT variable with the value of the current object from the for loop statement
            

return the ELEMENT variable
