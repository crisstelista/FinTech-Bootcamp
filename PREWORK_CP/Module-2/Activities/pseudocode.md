#Pseudocode

```
calculate percent increase as ((current price - original price)/original price) * 100

if percent increase is positive (greater than 0)
    then it means that the price has increased
else if percent increase is negative (less than 0)
    then it means that the price has decreased
else, meaning the percent increase is 0, it means that the price did not increase or decrease at all.
```
